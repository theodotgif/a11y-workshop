        <p className="mb-2">
          The origins of Kabaddi can be traced back thousands of years to
          ancient India, where it was played as a form of combat training and
          entertainment. Over time, it evolved into a structured sport with
          defined rules and regulations.

        <p className="mb-2">
          Kabaddi is played between two teams, each comprising seven players.
          The objective is for a "raider" to enter the opponent's half, tag as
          many defenders as possible, and return to their own half without being
          tackled.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game requires strength, agility, and quick thinking, making it a
          thrilling spectacle for both players and spectators alike.
