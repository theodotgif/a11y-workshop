        Korfball: The Mixed-Gender Team Sport
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg">

        Originating in the Netherlands, it has gained popularity for its dynamic
        gameplay and emphasis on gender equality.

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">History</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Korfball was invented in the early 20th century by Dutch schoolteacher
          Nico Broekhuysen as a way to encourage participation among both boys
          and girls in physical education classes. It quickly gained popularity
          and spread to other countries.

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Gameplay</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Korfball is played between two teams of eight players, with four males
          and four females on each team. The objective is to score points by
          shooting a ball through a raised hoop, similar to basketball.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets Korfball apart is its unique rule that prohibits players
          from shooting if they are being defended by a member of the opposite
          sex, promoting teamwork and cooperation.

        <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Inclusivity</h2>
        <p>
          Korfball&apos;s emphasis on gender equality and mixed-gender teams has
          contributed to its widespread appeal and adoption in schools and
          communities around the world. It serves as a shining example of how
          sports can bring people together regardless of gender or background.
