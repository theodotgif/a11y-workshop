          In Bo-taoshi, two teams compete against each other to lower the
          opponent's pole. Each team consists of attackers and defenders. The
          attackers aim to bring down the pole to a 30-degree angle, while the
          defenders strive to keep it upright.

          The game is marked by its chaotic nature, with players engaging in
          physical clashes and strategic maneuvers to gain the upper hand. It
          requires teamwork, coordination, and agility.
